# youtubePythonDownloader
This program is a Python script that allows you to download videos or audio from YouTube. It uses the "yt-dlp" library, which must be installed in the working directory before running the script. You enter the URL of the YouTube video and specify whether you want to download the video (V) or the audio (A).
